<p> The invention of the printing press was made by Johannes Gutenberg. The printing press helped us write books faster than it was before in the olden times. The printing press also could print books as different sizes, colours and fonts. </p>

     <p> The printing press made us print sheets of different sizes and colours and also made us create books quicker than ever. Johannes Gutenberg was famous (i think) for making the Printing Press come true. The printing press was also used to print out money which we use in our everyday lives. The printing press has changed from a big humongous stamp to high-tech printers. The history of the printing press is surprisingly famous as it has written tons of books under a week and thousands in a month. Who knows how many books our printers can print under a year, decade or century? </p> </li> </h2>
