          <h2 id="part1"> Why I think Electricity is amazing!</h2> 
      
            <p>Electricity helped us do amazing things as well as seeing in the dark. Benjamin Franklin is famous ( i think ) for inventing Electricity from thunder. Electricity may be helpful but can be dangerous as when one touches an electric object with no security whatsoever, you will get a stinging and painful zap. This can also occur when being hit by thunder. The history of Electricity is surprisingly famous as it improved our lives by a lot of percentages. Who knows what electricity can do if used for extreme uses like natural disasters? </p>
