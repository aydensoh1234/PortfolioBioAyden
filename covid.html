    <p> The coronavirus can cause death, trouble breathing, sneezing and fevers. If the Coronavirus enters your body, your lungs might become inflamed, making it tough for you to breathe. This can lead to pneumonia, an infection of the tiny air sacs (called alveoli) inside your lungs where your blood exchanges oxygen and carbon dioxide. This is the info about Coronavirus. It sounds painful, so try and not get the Coronavirus by reading these tips below. The coronavirus is a deadly germ and was also found from an animal which was a bat. It started in China as in China, they had this thing called " BAT SOUP ". No offense Batman or anything but it is kind of true. The coronavirus started in 2020 which is the year I am making this article. I actually hope those who are outside every day are okay during this year of thr beginning of Coronavirus. The coronavirus also started at about 2019 December or 2020 January. I do not really know but I do know we started wearing masks at December so I think it is 2019 December.
